# Goofy-Grandad

of love and happiness. It gives users an easy way to learn more about the 
philosophies and services of Joe (the Goofy Grandad) and connect with him for 
potential opportunities.

## Release Notes version Goofy-Grandad 1.0

###NEW FEATURES

- Made the questions on the FAQ page clickable by themselves to expand the answers.
- Created a separate page for contacting Joe about real estate opportunities 
(not essential to this project but requested by Joe).


###BUG FIXES

- Fixed Youtube icon only appearing in footer for one second after loading page.
- Fixed the booking button on the events page giving no response on click in 
certain browsers.
- Darkened the yellow color of “happiness” on the home page so that it does 
not appear washed out for some types of monitors. 
- Contact page no longer displays white flash on being redirected to from the 
events page and the reviews page.


###KNOWN BUGS

- When a user clicks on a question on the FAQ page, the page will reload and 
scroll back to top instead of staying on the question just clicked.
